# My Curriculum Vitae

## Project Analysis

The final user of my project is primarily employers or recruiters. These users are expected to find a well-structured and visually appealing representation of my qualifications and experiences.
The CV serves a platform to quickly and easily identify my contact information, laboral experience, skills and information about me.

My CV is structured in three columns. 
In the leftmost column, I present a dynamic visual representation of my skills. Utilizing progress bars, I offer a concise overview of my proficiency in various programming languages. 
The central column talks about who I am both professionally and personally. It features a narrative section that provides a glimpse into my background, motivations, and aspirations. Additionally, it lists my professional work experience.
In the rightmost column, you'll find essential contact information to facilitate communication. This section includes my email address and other contact details. Furthermore, it highlights the languages I speak.

I used a mix of blues and oranges, along with the Inter font, to make my CV look more visually appealing. This design choice gives my CV a modern and energetic vibe.
